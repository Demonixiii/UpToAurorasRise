Your name is Miles Winters. You're an average person with an average life.

Until your friends invite you to go out with them on the 19th of September 1996.
The last thing you remember is taking shots with them before everything went black.

As you finally open your eyes slowly, you can hear drops of water dripping on the cold, hard floor that you're laying on.
Looking around you don't recognize your surroundings. You sit up in an old basement, broken furniture sits along the walls.
Cobwebs in the corners and the smell of mold makes it clear nobody had lived here in a long time.
You push through the pain and get up. You hear a click, although you don't know where it came from.

You start investigating the room. As you approach a cabinet with an empty glass bottle on top, you hear groaning behind you.
Turning around, you see a big pale humanoid figure with long limbs. It's blood red eyes are fixated on you, and it's mouth dripping with some black substance.
Instinctively you reach for the glass bottle and throw it at the creature. The creature screeches and stumbles back before it's now lifeless body drops to the floor.
You take a few deep breaths to calm down. You're defenseless again since the glass bottle shattered.

You don't know why you're here, but you know you have to get to safety as soon as possible.
Especially if there's more of these creatures crawling around.
